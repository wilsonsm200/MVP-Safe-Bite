# MVP-Safe-Bite

> **Scan Smart. Eat Safe. Live Well.**

SafeBite is a mobile-first HealthTech app built with React Native. Scan a barcode, **snap an ingredients label with no barcode at all**, or **photograph a restaurant menu** — and get an AI-powered safety analysis personalised to your medical profile: allergies, chronic conditions, medications, and your whole family.

What makes SafeBite different: it checks food against your **medications and conditions**, not just calories — and it works even when a product isn't in any barcode database.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

Ensuring food safety is hard for both **consumers** and **shopkeepers**:

- People with **allergies**, **diabetes**, **heart disease** or other conditions can't easily verify whether a food is safe for them.
- People on **medication** are unaware of dangerous food–drug interactions hiding in everyday products.
- Most barcode scanners hit a dead end when a product **isn't in the database** — common for local, loose, or small-brand foods.
- **Eating out** is the scariest scenario for allergy/medication users, with no easy way to vet a menu.
- Families have no way to check safety across **multiple health profiles** in one scan.
- Shopkeepers overlook **stock and expiry management**, causing waste and risk.

> Per WHO, anaphylaxis-related deaths are rising. SafeBite puts clinical-grade food safety in everyone's hands.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Three ways to scan

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Barcode / QR Scan** | EAN13, EAN8, QR, Code128, UPC-A/E and more → full product info + AI safety verdict |
| **📸 Snap the Label** | No barcode (or not in the database)? Photograph the **ingredients list** — a vision model reads it and runs the same safety pipeline. Works for *any* packaged food |
| **🍽️ Eat-Out Menu Scanner** | Photograph a restaurant menu — every dish is rated **Safe / Caution / Avoid** for your profile, sorted worst-first |

### 🛡️ Personalised safety

- 🧠 **AI Ingredient Analysis** — a personalised summary based on your allergies, conditions, diet and medications.
- 💊 **Medication × Food Interaction Alerts** — detects dangerous combos (Warfarin + leafy greens, Statins + grapefruit, …) with prominent warnings. Re-checked deterministically on-device, not just by the model.
- ⚠️ **Deterministic Allergen Matching** — a synonym map so a "Nuts" allergy is flagged by "almond"/"peanut", not only the literal word.
- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Family Profiles** — one account, multiple health profiles; switch the active profile with one tap and every AI flow adapts.

### 🔔 Proactive recall alerts

SafeBite doesn't stop protecting you when you close the app. It remembers every product you've scanned and cross-checks them against the live **openFDA food recall feed**. If a product you've scanned gets recalled, you get a **push notification** — even with the app closed — and a red alert banner on Home.

- 📡 **Live recall monitoring** — matches your scanned products against official recall data on every app open.
- 🎯 **Profile-aware severity** — if the recall reason (e.g. *"undeclared peanuts"*) matches the active profile's allergies, the alert is escalated with a **"do not eat"** warning tied to that person.
- 🛌 **Works in the background** — be warned about food already in your kitchen before you eat it.

### 🤖 Sage — AI Health Co-pilot

**Sage** is a conversational assistant (powered by **Google Gemini**) you can ask anything — *"Can I eat this with my warfarin?"*, *"What should I avoid today?"*, *"Suggest a safe snack."* It's grounded in your **active health profile** (allergies, conditions, medications, diet) **and your recently scanned products**, so every answer is personal — not generic. Reachable from the **Ask Sage** button on Home — or tap **Ask Sage about this** on any product to start a chat focused on that exact item.

### ♿ Accessibility

- 🔊 **Read-aloud verdict** — enable it from **Profile → Accessibility**, and a **Listen** button appears on every product to read the whole safety verdict aloud (name → allergens → medication interactions → AI summary), so low-vision, elderly, or hands-busy users can *hear* whether a food is safe. The co-pilot's answers can be read aloud too.

### 🍳 Eat better

- **Recipe Suggestions** — enter the ingredients you have → health-safe recipes that respect your allergies, diet, conditions and medications.
- **7-Day Meal Planner** — a profile-safe weekly plan plus an auto shopping list.
- **Healthier Swaps** — scan a poorly-rated product and get safer, better-rated alternatives from a 5,000-product database.
- **Smart Recommendations** — AI-filtered products matched to your full health profile.

### 📊 Track & stay motivated

- **Daily Health Score** — a 0–100 score from today's logged food vs. your condition-adjusted limits.
- **Safe-Eating Streak** — consecutive qualifying days, to build the habit.
- **Nutrition Tracker & Food Diary** — calories, sugar, fat, salt, protein vs. personalised limits that auto-tighten for your conditions.
- **7-Day Trends** — a per-day sugar & salt chart with a plain-language read ("your sodium is trending up"), so the tracker shows movement over time, not just today's snapshot.

### 🩺 Clinical companion

- 💊 **Food × Medication cross-link at log time** — when you add a food to your diary that interacts with one of your medications (e.g. *grapefruit while on a statin*), SafeBite flags it the moment you log it, tags the diary entry, and shows a daily "items that interact with your medication" banner.
- ⏰ **Medication reminders with food-timing warnings** — schedule a daily dose reminder for each medication; the notification also names the foods to avoid around that dose (e.g. *"Time for your statin — avoid grapefruit within a few hours"*), turning the food–drug interaction map into a proactive nudge. Reminders are profile-aware and stay in sync as you edit your medications.
- 📄 **Export Health Report (PDF)** — generate a shareable 7-day report — health profile, personalised daily limits, food diary grouped by day, and every flagged food–medication interaction — and send it straight to your **doctor or dietitian** from the native share sheet. Positions SafeBite as a clinical companion, not just a scanner.

### 🏠 Home & convenience

- **Recently Scanned** carousel — reopen recent products instantly (offline-friendly).
- **Personalised Daily Tip** — rotates based on your medications/conditions/allergies.
- **Offline Scan Cache** — last 50 products + AI summaries cached locally; works with no signal.

### 👤 Account & settings

- **Edit Health Profile** — update allergies, conditions, diet, medications, age & severity anytime.
- **Change Password** (Supabase auth), **Privacy Policy**, **Share SafeBite**, and **☕ Support us**.

### 🏪 For shopkeepers

- **Inventory Management** — add / edit / delete products (name, price, stock, rating, expiry, image), stored per-shopkeeper in Supabase with row-level security.
- **Insights Dashboard** — live stats (total / out-of-stock / expiring-soon), search, and colour-coded stock & expiry badges.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

Supabase tables that power the app:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `Users` | Account info, shopkeeper flag |
| `Customerdetails` | Health profile — allergies, conditions, medications, dietary |
| `Shopkeepers` | Business details for shopkeeper accounts |
| `family_members` | Additional health profiles per account |
| `nutrition_logs` | Daily food diary entries per user (incl. `med_flags` — see `supabase/nutrition_logs_med_flags.sql`) |
| `recommended_products` | Profile-hash keyed cache for AI recommendations |
| `shop_products` | Per-shopkeeper inventory (RLS-scoped) — see `supabase/shop_products.sql` |

---

## 🧪 How it works

1. **Three capture modes** — barcode (Open Food Facts), label photo (vision OCR), menu photo (vision).
2. **Vision pipeline** — photos are downscaled on-device, then a Groq vision model extracts ingredients (label) or rates dishes (menu); the heavy lifting runs on Groq, so the free-tier backend only proxies.
3. **Rule + LLM safety** — deterministic allergen/medication matching layered with LLM summaries (defence in depth).
4. **Profile-hash caching** — avoids re-running AI for the same health profile.
5. **Condition-aware limits** — daily nutrition thresholds tighten automatically per condition, feeding the tracker and health score.
6. **Family architecture** — the active profile is persisted in AsyncStorage and drives every AI flow.
7. **Offline-first** — scans, recommendations and tips fall back to local cache.
8. **Recall monitoring** — on each app open, scanned products are matched against the openFDA recall feed; a match fires a local push and a Home banner, escalated when the recall reason hits the active profile's allergies.
